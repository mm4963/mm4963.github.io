I am a doctoral candidate in Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My research focuses on causal inference methods with an application on global health, health disparities and environmental health studies.

Currently, I work with [Dr. Linda Valeri](https://www.lindavaleri.com/) on the evaluation of the external validity of epidemiological investigations on environmental mixtures and on the evaluation of the current available machine learning approaches for the analysis of the effects of environmental mixtures on failure time outcomes. 


My CV can be reached [here](about.html).
