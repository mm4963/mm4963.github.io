Welcome to my website. Here I will tell a bit about myself as well as demonstrate some of the skills I have developed.

I am a biostatistics PhD candidate at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am mainly interested in causal inference, particularly in application to global health and health disparities.

My resume can be reached [here](about.html).

Some demonstration of plots I have done can be reached [here](dashboard.html).
